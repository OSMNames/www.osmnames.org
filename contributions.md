The original OSMNames open-source project generating the dataset from OpenStreetMap is a result of the work of a semester thesis (Andreas Egloff) from the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil, Switzerland, and was done in cooperation with Klokan Technologies GmbH. The company team has developed the open-source search system with autocomplete (instant search) functionality.

Anybody can reuse the open-source software, customize the data and adapt our workflows. We hope the community will contribute back and help us improve this database.
